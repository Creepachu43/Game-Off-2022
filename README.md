# Game-Off-2022
This is the source code and assets for my team's game for the 2022 GitHub game off hosted on itch.io.

*We have decided not to choose an open source license because we are planning to commercially release our game once the game jam is over.*

However, if there is part of our code or assets that you would like to use feel free to contact us and ask permission.
